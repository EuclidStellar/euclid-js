# euclid-js | Node.js Backend Generator

Euclid is a CLI tool designed to streamline the creation of a Node.js backend project. It generates a well-structured project folder with best practices, installs necessary dependencies, and provides template code to help you start quickly.

## Features

- **Generates a Standard Node.js Project Structure**: Quickly set up a consistent project layout.
- **Installs Common Dependencies**: Automatically installs essential libraries and tools for backend development.
- **Provides Template Code**: Includes base code for `index.js` and routes to jump-start your application.
- **CLI Interaction**: Beautiful command-line interface for a smooth user experience.
- **Optional Authentication Setup**: Choose to include authentication-related files and setup.

## Installation

To install the Euclid Generator globally, use npm:

```bash
npm install -g euclidstellar
```

## Usage

After installing the package globally, you can generate a new project by running the following command:

```bash
euclid <project-name>
```

Replace `<project-name>` with your desired project name. This command will create a folder with the specified project name and set up the project structure and dependencies.

### CLI Interaction

When you run the CLI, you will interact with the following prompts:

1. **Welcome Message**: Displays a welcome message with developer information and project details.
2. **Project Name Prompt**: Asks for the name of the project.
3. **Generate Auth Part**: Prompts whether to include authentication-related code.
   - **Y**: Includes authentication setup and additional files.
   - **N**: Only generates the basic project structure and core files.

### Example CLI Interaction

Here's an example of how the CLI might look when you run it:

```bash
$ euclid my-awesome-project

  ==================================================
  =                                                =
  =                  EUCLID-JS                     =
  =           A Project Generator CLI              =
  =                                                =

## Project Structure

The generated project will have the following structure:

```
<project-name>/
â”œâ”€â”€ README.md
â”œâ”€â”€ package.json
â”œâ”€â”€ index.js
â”œâ”€â”€ src
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ controllers
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ models
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ routes
â”‚   â”‚   â””â”€â”€ index.js
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ utils
â”‚   â”‚   â””â”€â”€ jwt.js
â”‚   â””â”€â”€ services 
â””â”€â”€ tests
```

- `index.js`: Entry point of your application.
- `src/controllers`: Folder for your controllers.
- `src/models`: Folder for your models.
- `src/routes`: Folder for your routes.
- `src/services`: Folder for your services.
- `tests`: Folder for your tests.
- `jwt.js`: Script for handling generation and verification of JSON Web Tokens (included if authentication setup is selected).

## Template Code

### `index.js`

The `index.js` file is the main entry point of your application and includes basic setup code:

```javascript
const express = require('express');
const app = express();
const port = process.env.PORT || 3000;

app.use(express.json());
app.use(express.urlencoded({ extended: true }));

// Import routes
const routes = require('./src/routes');

// Use routes
app.use('/api', routes);

app.listen(port, () => {
  console.log(`Server is running on port ${port}`);
});
```

### `src/routes/index.js`

The `index.js` file in the routes folder includes a basic route setup:

```javascript
const express = require('express');
const router = express.Router();

// Define your routes here
router.get('/', (req, res) => {
  res.send('Welcome to the API');
});

module.exports = router;
```

## Dependencies

The generated project includes the following dependencies:

- `express`: Web framework for Node.js.
- `mongoose`: MongoDB object modeling tool.
- `dotenv`: Module to load environment variables from a `.env` file.
- `jsonwebtoken`: Implementation of JSON Web Tokens.
- `bcryptjs`: Library to hash passwords.
- `cors`: Middleware to enable CORS.
